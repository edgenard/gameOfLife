I'm thinking more and more that the UI tests in life.spec.js might be unnecessary. Because I've already tested that the table is representation of the grid in table.spec.js. Beyond the table being there and checking that clicking the buttons or cells call the right functions I'm not sure any other test is useful in life.spec.js. And since sinonjs doesn't seem to work well with webpack I don't think tests checking whether a function is called or not is worth it.
