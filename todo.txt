 - Clicking playButton a second time must pause interval
  I think the best way to do this would be to use a spy and
  check that clearInterval is called
 - Clicking a third time must restart interval
    spy to check that setInterval is called
 - Clicking clear must remove the interval
    spy to check that clearInterval is called.
